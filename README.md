# vala_interpreter

This repository contains an interpreter and a virtual machine for a Vala-like language.

The interpreter and the virtual machine is a project for the course "Abstrakte Maschinen" at the Vienna University of Technology.

So if any one wants to contribute to this project - please wait until I have finished the course or just fork the project :)
